# Scrabble

The aim of this development initiative is to create a Scrabble game using the Python programming language, following the rules and principles outlined in the Wikipedia entry on the game. 
The resulting game will allow users to participate in Scrabble matches via a text-based interface and will include functions for the game board, 
letter tiles, scoring and word validity checking.
