# Scrabble

The objective of this development initiative is to build a Scrabble video game using the Python programming language, adhering to the regulations and principles outlined in the Wikipedia entry about the Scrabble game. The resulting game will enable users to engage in Scrabble matches through a text-based interface, featuring capabilities for the game board, letter tiles, scoring, and verifying the validity of words.
